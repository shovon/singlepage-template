# Single Page Template

A barebones starter project for creating single page websites, with load time in mind.

## Getting started

Be sure that you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed (I'm assuming that npm also comes installed with the latest Node.js). Then, clone or download this repo. Then, `cd` into, and run

```
npm install
```

## Developing

Just run:

```
npm run dev
```

And then, edit the content of the `src` folder to your heart's content.

## Distributing

Just run:

```
npm run build
```
