# Single Page Template

A barebones starter project for creating single page websites, with load time and [developer experience](http://nordicapis.com/why-api-developer-experience-matters-more-than-ever/) in mind.

## Getting started

Be sure that you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed (I'm assuming that npm also comes installed with the latest Node.js). Then, clone or download this repo. Then, `cd` into, and run

```
npm install
```

## Developing

Just run:

```
npm run dev
```

And then, edit the content of the `src` folder to your heart's content.

You can then view your changes over at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). Better yet, you can install [LiveReload](http://livereload.com/) for your web browser of choice, and see the latest changes without having to hit refresh!

## Distributing

Just run:

```
npm run build
```

And your site should be readily available in the `public` folder.
